# salary-prediction

This is a prediction and a visualization ,in which I made the prediction using python for a task that was assigned to me in a virtual internship.The given dataset is cleaned,modified and certain algorithms have been applied and the salary of the employee is predicted.A visualization is made by taking into account a few factors that influence the employee's salary the most.I have used tableau software for that purpose.
